# Network Security

- Security of multiple computers
- Protect data in storage and in transit.
- Wider field of study than computer security
	- Cryptographic
	- Communication
	- Transport and exchange protocols
	- Best practices for establishing and maintaining networks
- You need to protect not just data but resources

# Information security

Involves study of mathematical designs of cryptographic, communication transport and exchange protocols.  
Encoding and encrypting algorithms.  

# Securing the computer network

- Protect from internal as well as external unauthorised access.
- Resources are both physical and virtual, Systems can be tangible and non tangible

Tangible Hardware resources  
Non Tangible Information and Data  

# Securing Hardware

We protect the user interface hardware like input components.  
Networks hardware componenent like hubs, switches, routers and gateways which are vulnerable
need to be secured.  
Netowrk communication channels to prevent eavesdroppers for intercepting network communications.  

# Software 

Protect operating systems and applications, storage devices.  

# Forms of protection - 5 Pillars of information assuarance

1. Access control
2. Authentication
3. Confidentiality
4. Integrity
5. Non repudiation
